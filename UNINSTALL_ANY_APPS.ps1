# NAME: SilentUninstall.ps1
# SYNOPSIS: Uninstall one or more programs given a search query
# COPYRIGHT: Dave Baker, Maybank Systems, (c) 2014
#
#
# SYNTAX
# SilentUninstall.ps1 <search> [-u] [-nosim] [-verbose]
#
# Search terms with multiple words should be enclosed in quotes -- examples:
# > SilentUninstall.ps1 cisco
# > SilentUninstall.ps1 "cisco anyconnect"   
# 
# Searches are for EXACT terms, so a search for "Microsoft Office" would return 
# "Microsoft Office 2013" and "Update for Microsoft Office", but NOT "Microsoft
# Update KB851215 for Office 2013"
# 
# Without the -u flag, simply returns a list of programs that would be uninstalled. It is 
# STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to run the program without the -u flag first, to see what would actually
# be uninstalled.  
# 
# Provide the -u flag to SIMULATE uninstalling all found programs. To actually perform
# an uninstall, add the -nosim flag. **WARNING: Use with # caution -- there is NO confirmation!**
#
# > SilentUninstall.ps1 cisco -u          -- SIMULATES uninstalling EVERY program found with  
#                                         the word "cisco" in the name, one at a time.
#
# > SilentUninstall.ps1 cisco -u -nosim   -- ACTUALLY uninstalls EVERY program found with the word 
#                                         "cisco" in the name, one at a time.
#
# The -nosim flag exists to reduce the possibility of an accidental uninstallation.  
#
# The -verbose option turns on some (extremely) rudimentary error reporting.  
#
# 
# METHODOLOGY
# Iterate "Uninstall" registry subkeys within the following key(s):
# - HKLM:\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\uninstall
# - HKLM:\software\wow6432node\microsoft\windows\currentversion\uninstall 
#        (on 64-bit systems)
# Check the given search term against the name of the software package.  If
# a package matches the term, list it on screen.  If the -u flag is provided,
# uninstall the program using one of the methods below, in order of preference:
#   1. (MSI installers only) Execute MsiExec with the /quiet flag
#   2. If the program registry key has a "QuietUninstallString" value, 
#      use that to uninstall the program
#   3. Otherwise use the "UninstallString" value
#      (In a future version, check against a known table of programs and
#      "silent" uninstall switches and use the appropriate switch if a
#      recognized program is found, e.g. Steam or VLC)
#
# PURPOSE
# The ultimate goal of this script is to uninstall programs silently, e.g.
# without any GUI feedback or user intervention.  MSI-installed programs
# are of course easy to uninstall silently; the trickier part is accomplishing
# this goal for programs installed using non-MSI installers like Inno or 
# Nullsoft's NSIS packager. "Silent" switches are available for almost every
# uninstall executable in the wild, and over time I will build out a table
# of known programs and corresponding "silent" switches for their uninstall
# executables.  This script could be used in conjunction with an RMM platform
# such as Kaseya or N-Able, to automate uninstalls without interrupting or
# requiring input from the end user.

# TODO LIST
# - Maintain a list of "silent" uninstall switches like /silent, /S, -s, /quiet etc.
#   for known non-MSI programs like e.g. Steam.  When a recognized program is run, 
#   tack on the appropriate "silent" switch.  
#
#  STEAM   uninstall.exe /S      
#  VLC     uninstall.exe /S      2.1.5
#  7-ZIP   Uninstall.exe /S      (32 bit version only; 64-bit uses MSI)
#
# - Handle programs that are in Programs and Features list, but don't show up in 
#   search results ... where are the uninstall reg keys for these programs?  
# - More and better error handling and reporting
# - Ability to email results when finished
